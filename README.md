## 👋 Meet the Developer

Hi there! I'm **Yash Magar**, a passionate Full Stack Developer dedicated to
building clean, high-performance web and mobile applications. I specialize in
React ecosystem, UI/UX design, and creating intuitive digital experiences.

**Nirmeeti** was born from a simple idea: developers shouldn't have to search
for 12 different websites to do 5 simple tasks. I wanted to build a centralized,
privacy-focused home for the daily tools we all use.

## 🚀 About the Project

**Nirmeeti** is a modern, all-in-one generator suite designed for developers,
designers, and content creators. It features a polished "Glassmorphism" UI,
instant client-side processing, and a distraction-free experience.

### Key Features

  ever sent to a server.
- **⚡ Lightning Fast**: Built with React and Vite for instant load times and
  generation.
- **🎨 Premium UI/UX**: Features a "Bento Grid" dashboard, smooth animations,
  and a unified sidebar navigation.
- **📱 Native Android App**: Available as a fully offline Android application!
- **🛠️ 12+ Powerful Tools**:

    (UUID/NanoID).
  - **Design**: Color Palette, CSS Gradient, Placeholder Image.
