## 👋 Meet the Developer

Hi there! I'm **Yash Magar**, a passionate Full Stack Developer dedicated to
building clean, high-performance web applications. I specialize in React
ecosystem, UI/UX design, and creating intuitive digital experiences.

**UtilityHub** was born from a simple idea: developers shouldn't have to search
for 12 different websites to do 5 simple tasks. I wanted to build a centralized,
privacy-focused home for the daily tools we all use.

## 🚀 About the Project

**UtilityHub** is a modern, all-in-one generator suite designed for developers,
designers, and content creators. It features a polished "Glassmorphism" UI,
instant client-side processing, and a distraction-free experience.

### Key Features

- **🛡️ Privacy First**: All calculations happen 100% on your device. No data is
  ever sent to a server.
- **⚡ Lightning Fast**: Built with React and Vite for instant load times and
  generation.
- **🎨 Premium UI/UX**: Features a "Bento Grid" dashboard, smooth animations,
  and a unified sidebar navigation.
- **🛠️ 12+ Powerful Tools**:
  - **Security**: Password Generator (with Strength Meter), Unique ID
    (UUID/NanoID).
  - **Design**: Color Palette, CSS Gradient, Placeholder Image.
  - **Data**: Profile Generator, Random Number, QRCode.
  - **Content**: Lorem Ipsum, Random Quote, Hashtag Generator.
